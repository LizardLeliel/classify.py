Requisites
----------
This program requires these conditions to run: <br>
- You are on windows (linux support expected to be soon) <br>
- You have gzip.exe in the same directory as the program <br>
- You have the directories temp, classes, and data in the same directory
as the program <br>
- And preferably, you have unique types in \classes (i.e only one jpeg, one txt file, etc..),
and numerous different files in the data \data

What the heck does this program do?!?

It tries to match the files in \data to files in \classes.

It uses information distance to acheive this
